# suggestion-map
A simple Go package to map a yaml file of suggestions to a list of matches and responses.


TODO:
* Rename project to `suggestionbox`
* Improve ergonomics (is `LoadFile` the right starting place?)
* Add ability to load from a remote source (JSON?)
* Pre-compile regex when loading matchers
